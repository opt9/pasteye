A pastebin monitoring tool. Soon to be: Pastebin Monitoring as a Service

## Installation

(Requires [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/))

1. `git clone` the repo

2. `npm install .`

3. Configure config.js and .env appropriately

4. `grunt server` to start the server in the development environment

5. `grunt build` for a production build (will end up in the dist folder)

6. `grunt server:dist` to run server in production environment (will automatically re-build and serve from dist)

7. `grunt test` to run tests

## API Key Logic

On User create, API key is generated.

Key has following properties:

+ Is unique to user

+ Is seemingly 'random' to user

+ Cannot be regenerated or 'guessed' easily

+ Is therefore implied to be 'secure'

Although there is no collision check per se, the current chance of collision is: 4.4224999038811237107994661897277682453123397014Ã—10^90 : 1.

For every request, API key is passed first. API key ties API actions to user.

## API Request Structure & Access

GET /api/users {apikey: (apikey)}--> Returns all Users (ADMIN)

GET /api/users/:id {apikey: (apikey)}--> Returns User with specified ID (ADMIN)

GET /api/users/:id/settings {apikey: (apikey)}--> Returns User Settings with specified ID (ADMIN)

POST /api/users {username: (username), password: (password), userEmail: (userEmail)} --> Creates User with no settings (ALL)

POST /api/users {username: (username), password: (password), userEmail: (userEmail), ip: (IP restriction), email: (email restriction), hash: (hash restriction)} --> Creates User with settings ip, email, and hash (ALL)

POST /api/users {apikey: (apikey), users: [{username: (username1), password: (password1), userEmail: (userEmail1), ip: (IP restriction1), email: (email restriction1), hash: (hash restriction1)}, {username: (username2)... hash: (hash restriction2)}, ...]} --> Creates users 1-* with allocated settings (ADMIN)

POST /api/users {apikey: (apikey), users: [{username: (username1), password: (password1), userEmail: (userEmail1)}, {username: (username2)... userEmail: (userEmail2)}, ...]} --> Creates users 1-* with no settings (ADMIN)

PUT /api/users/:id {apikey: (apikey), password: (password), userEmail: (userEmail), ip: (IP restriction), email: (email restriction), hash: (hash restriction)} --> Updates a User (via ID) with the given settings (USER)(ADMIN)

DELETE /api/users {apikey: (apikey), username: (username)} --> Deletes a user (USER)(ADMIN)

DELETE /api/users {apikey: (apikey), id: (id)} --> Deletes a user via ID (USER)(ADMIN)

DELETE /api/users {apikey: (apikey), users: [{username: (username)}, {username: (username2)}]} --> Deletes a set of users via username (ADMIN)

DELETE /api/users {apikey: (apikey), users: [{id: (id)}, {id: (id2)}]} --> Deletes a set of users via ID (ADMIN)
