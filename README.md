Pastebin Monitoring as a Service

## Why?

Well, why not? It's an interesting side project, and can be rather useful to some people. Great for breach notifications (i.e: realtime notification if a large DB has been pasted to Pastebin), and future versions will have custom filter features which would allow you to monitor for anything (i.e: Your own e-mail, to see if you have been compromised). 

Another aspect of this is the fact that there is no data as to *who* uses pastebin, and how. It would be interesting to analyze the data that surrounds pastebin usage and tangential fields.

## Installation

> *(Requires [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/))*

1. `git clone` the repo

2. `npm install .`

3. Configure `config.js` and `.env` appropriately

4. `grunt server` to start the server in the development environment

5. `grunt build` for a production build (will end up in the dist folder)

6. `grunt server:dist` to run server in production environment (will automatically re-build and serve from dist)

7. `grunt test` to run tests

## API Key Logic

On User create, API key is generated.

Key has following properties:

+ Is unique to user

+ Is seemingly 'random' to user

+ Cannot be regenerated or 'guessed' easily

+ Is therefore implied to be 'secure'

Although there is no collision check per se, the current chance of collision is: 4.4224999038811237107994661897277682453123397014Ã—10^90 : 1.

For every request, API key is passed first. API key ties API actions to user.

## API Request Structure & Access

 **All endpoints will be expecting properly formatted JSON.**
 An example of a properly formatted request is: `curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"apikey": "<someapikey>"}' http://host.com/api/users/3`

 If entry is appended with *(ADMIN)*, request must be made by an Admin. 

 If *(USER)*, request can be made by the User for their own account. 

 If *(ALL)*, anyone can make the request.

#### Returns all Users (ADMIN)

>GET /api/users 
```json
{ "apikey": "(apikey)" }
```


#### Returns User with specified ID (ADMIN)

>GET /api/users/:id
 ```json
 { "apikey": "(apikey)" }
 ```

#### Returns User Settings with specified ID (ADMIN)

>GET /api/users/:id/settings 
```json
{ "apikey": "(apikey)" }
```

#### Creates User with no settings (ALL)

>POST /api/users
```json
 { "username": "(username)", "password": "(password)", "userEmail": "(userEmail)" }
 ```

#### Creates User with settings ip, email, and hash (ALL)

>POST /api/users
```json
 { "username": "(username)", "password": "(password)", "userEmail": "(userEmail)", "ip": "(IP threshold)", "email": "(Email threshold)", "hash": "(Hash threshold)" }
 ```

#### Creates users 1-* with allocated settings (ADMIN)

>POST /api/users
```json
 { "apikey": "(apikey)", "users": [{"username": "(username1)", "password": "(password1)", "userEmail": "(userEmail1)", "ip": "(IP threshold1)", "email": "(Email threshold1)", "hash": "(Hash threshold1)"}, {"username": "(username2)"... "hash": "(Hash threshold2)"}, ...] } 
 ```

#### Creates users 1-* with no settings (ADMIN)

>POST /api/users
```json
 { "apikey": "(apikey)", "users": [{"username": "(username1)", "password": "(password1)", "userEmail": "(userEmail1)"}, {"username": "(username2)"... "userEmail": "(userEmail2)"}, ...] }
 ```

#### Updates a User (via ID) with the given settings (USER)(ADMIN)

>PUT /api/users/:id
```json
 { "apikey": "(apikey)", "password": "(password)", "userEmail": "(userEmail)", "ip": "(IP threshold)", "email": "(Email threshold)", "hash": "(Hash threshold)" }
 ```

#### Deletes a user (USER)(ADMIN)

>DELETE /api/users 
```json
{ "apikey": "(apikey)", "username": "(username)" }
```

#### Deletes a user via ID (USER)(ADMIN)

>DELETE /api/users
```json
 { "apikey": "(apikey)", "id": "(id)" }
 ```

#### Deletes a set of users via username (ADMIN)

>DELETE /api/users
```json
 { "apikey": "(apikey)", "users": [{"username": "(username)"}, {"username": "(username2)"}] }
 ```

#### Deletes a set of users via ID (ADMIN)

>DELETE /api/users
```json
 { "apikey": "(apikey)", "users": [{"id": "(id)"}, {"id": "(id2)"}] }
 ```
